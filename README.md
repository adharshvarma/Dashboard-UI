## Technology & Skills Demonstrated

This project is a deep dive into the capabilities of modern CSS and semantic HTML. The key skills showcased are:

- **HTML5:**

  - **Semantic Markup:** Use of `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<ul>` to create an accessible and SEO-friendly document structure.

- **CSS3:**
  - **CSS Grid:** For the primary two-column application layout (`.dashboard-container`).
  - **Flexbox:** For aligning items within components like the header, stat cards, and project list.
  - **Custom Properties (Variables):** Used extensively for a maintainable and easy-to-customize color scheme and spacing system.
  - **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach using `@media` queries to handle different viewport sizes gracefully.
  - **Advanced Selectors:** Use of pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `.active`) and pseudo-elements to style interactive elements without extra HTML.
  - **Typography & Spacing:** A strong focus on visual hierarchy, readability, and negative space to create a polished and professional look without images.
